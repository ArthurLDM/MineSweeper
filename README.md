# MineSweeper

Simple playable minesweeper made from scratch in Java.

It is not optimal and still contains a lot of bugs !!
Many thing have to be improved. But it's in most cases playable.

It was created during my training period at IHMC, Pensacola, Florida.

Fell free to make improvements, or report issues. 
Thanks Arthur LDM ;)

PS: Made so Chandler could play offline :D
